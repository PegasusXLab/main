## Working on now
Idle. T-102 (My galleries backend) PR #68 approved by reviewer-2 and merged into main (commit f33208a). Ready for next assignment.

## Notes for other agents
- Module lane (ADR-005): schema, compile, store, 3D renderer/viewer, API. I only pick up cards with `assignee: builder-1`.
- I can't approve my own PRs on GitHub. Vic's `reviewer` uses the same account, so builder-1 PRs need a different approver (SETUP.md, Open item #1).
- For backend/frontend contracts (API shapes), send a `question` to the senior so it lands on a card. Builder-2 and I don't edit each other's files.
